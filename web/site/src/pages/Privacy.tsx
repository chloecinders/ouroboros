            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy explains how the public instance of the Aegis Discord bot collects, uses, and
                protects your data.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Moderation Records: Actions store the type, target user ID, moderator ID, the reason, timestamps,
                    expiry along with optional references which can reference another Discord message or images. The
                    Discord Message then gets stored with the message content¹, author ID and the message link, which
                    includes the server, channel and message ID.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Server Configuration: Server settings/configuration options which may include channel and message
                    IDs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Message History: Message content¹, channel, guild and message IDs and attachment URLs. Content from
                    message edits is also stored¹.
                </li>
                <li>
                    User Flags: Strings of text which moderators can assign to users, these will be stored against the
                    users ID. Server administrators are responsible for disclosing if any user data is stored within
                    these strings.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Operational: Command execution timestamps together with trace timestamps for command execution
                    duration and command errors.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                1: Message content can be chosen to be encrypted by server administrators, which will require the bot to
                fetch a decryption key from inside the server.
            </p>

            <h3>Data Security and Encryption</h3>
            <p>
                We implement reasonable administrative and technical security measures to protect the data we collect.
                However, please be aware that message content encryption is an opt-in feature that must be explicitly
                configured by the server administrator.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a server administrator chooses not to enable encryption, message content and moderation logs
                collected by Aegis are stored in plain text. Because we cannot control a server administrator's
                configuration choices, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of unencrypted message content. Users
                are advised against sharing sensitive personal or financial information in channels where Aegis is
                active.
            </p>

            <h2>3. How We Use the Data</h2>
            <p>
                Any data collected is utilized to provide and fulfill the core moderation functionality of Aegis, with
                the addition of improving the service.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>
                Server and its members' data is stored indefinitely as long as the bot operates in a server. All data
                related to a server and its members is deleted upon the removal of the bot from the server.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Your Control and Data Deletion Rights</h2>
            <p>
                As a server administrator, you retain the right to manage your server's data. As a server member, you
                retain the rights to manage your user data within the servers Aegis operates in. Contact us via
                legal@chloecinders.com for data removal requests.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Self-Hosted Instances</h2>
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy strictly applies to the official public instance. Self-hosted instances are governed
                by their own guidelines.
            </p>
